<h2 id="Lamb_Hend_Ross"> Twisted (Lambert, Hendricks, Ross!)</h2>
<p>
<strong> My analyst told me (What?) </strong><br/ >
         That I was right out of my head <br/ >
         The way he described it (How?) <br/ >
         He said I'd be better dead than live <br/ >
         I didn't listen to his jive         <br/ >
         I knew all along, he was all wrong  <br/ >
         And I knew that he thought (What?) <br/ >
         I was crazy, but I'm not           <br/ >
         Oh no (Oh no?) (Oh no?)
</p>
<p>
<strong> My analyst told me (What?)</strong><br/ >
         That I was right out of my head <br/ >
         He said I'd need treatment (Yeah?) <br/ >
         But I'm not that easily led, he said <br/ >
         I was the type that was most inclined <br/ >
         When out of his sight, to be out of my mind <br/ >
         And he thought I was nuts (Nuts?) <br/ >
         No more ifs or ands or buts <br/ >
         Oh no (Oh no?) (Oh no?)
</p>
<p>
 <em><strong> They say as a child I appeared a little bit wild </strong></em> <br/ >
        With all my crazy ideas <br/ >
        But I knew what was happenin', I knew I was a genius <br/ >
        What's so strange when you know that you're a wizard at three? <br/ >
        I knew that this was meant to be <br/ >
        But I heard little children were supposed to sleep tight<br/ >
        That's why I drank a fifth of vodka one night <br/ >
        My parents got frantic, didn't know what to do <br/ >
        But I saw some crazy scenes before I came to <br/ >
        Now do you think I was crazy? <br/ >
        I may have been only three, but I was swingin' <br/ >
        They all laughed at A. Graham Bell  <br/ >
        They all laughed at Edison and also at Einstein <br/ >
        So why should I feel sorry if they just couldn't understand <br/ >
        The reasoning and the logic that went on in my head?   <br/ >
        I had a brain, it was insane, so I just let them laugh at me <br/ >
        When I refused to ride on all the double-decker buses <br/ >
        All because there was no driver on the top <br/ >
        No driver on the top? This chick is twisted, what's the matter with her? (She must be out of her head)

         But I said, dear doctor (Yeah?) <br/ >
         I think that it's you instead, 'cause I <br/ >
         Have got a thing that's unique and new <br/ >
         It proves that I'll have the last laugh on you <br/ >
         'Cause instead of one head (One head?) <br/ >
         Oh, I got two <br/ >
<em>     And you know two heads are better than one </em>

<h2 id="jacques_prevert">Les feuilles mortes </h2>
<p>
  <em><strong>
  Oh, je voudrais tant que tu te souviennes </em></strong><br/>
  Des jours heureux où nous étions amis   <br/>
  En ce temps-là, la vie était plus belle <br/>
  Et le soleil plus brûlant qu'aujourd'hui
</p>
<p>
  <em><strong>
  Les feuilles mortes se ramassent à la pelle </em></strong> <br/>
  Tu vois, je n'ai pas oublié                 <br/>
  Les feuilles mortes se ramassent à la pelle <br/>
  Les souvenirs et les regrets aussi
</p>
<p>
  <em><strong>
  Et le vent du Nord les emporte</em></strong><br/>
  Dans la nuit froide de l'oubli              <br/>
  Tu vois, je n'ai pas oublié                 <br/>
  La chanson que tu me chantais
</p>
<p>
  <em><strong>
  C'est une chanson qui nous ressemble</em></strong><br/>
  Toi tu m'aimais, et je t'aimais                   <br/>
  Nous vivions tous les deux ensemble               <br/>
  Toi qui m'aimais, moi qui t'aimais
</p>
<p>
<em><strong>
  Mais la vie sépare ceux qui s'aiment </em></strong> <br/>
  Tout doucement, sans faire de bruit                 <br/>
  Et la mer efface sur le sable                        <br/>
  Les pas des amants désunis
</p>
<p>
  La, la, la, la <br/>
  La, la, la, la <br/>
  La, la, la, la <br/>
  La, la, la, la <br/>
  La, la, la, la <br/>
  La, la, la, la <br/>
  La, la, la, la <br/>
  La, la, la, la
</p>
<p>
  <em><strong>
  Mais la vie sépare ceux qui s'aiment</em></strong><br/>
  Tout doucement, sans faire de bruit <br/>
  Et la mer efface sur le sable <br/>
  Les pas des amants désunis

<h2 id="Fats_waller">Ain't misbehavin'(Andy Razaf)</h2>

<p>
<strong><em>(Boy):</em> Tho' it's a fickle age, With flirting all the rage,</strong><br/ >
        Here is one bird with self-control, Happy inside my cage.<br/ >
        I know who I love best, Thumbs down for all the rest,<br/ >
        My love was given, heart and soul, So it can stand the test.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Chorus:</em>No one to talk with, all by myself </strong><br/ >
        No one to walk with, but I'm happy on the shelf,<br/ >
        Ain't Misbehavin', I'm savin' my love for you. <br/ >
        I know for certain the one I love,<br/ >
        I'm thru with flirtin', it's just you I'm thinkin' of,<br/ >
        Ain't Misbehavin', I'm savin' my love for you.
</p>

<p>
<strong> Like Jack Horner in the corner, don't go nowhere,What do I care,</strong><br/ >
         Your kisses are worth waitin' for, believe me.<br/ >
         I don't stay out late, don't care to go, <br/ >
         I'm home about eight, just me and my radio, <br/ >
         Ain't Misbehavin', I'm savin' my love for you.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>(Girl):</em> Your type of man is rare, I know you really care,</strong><br/ >
        That's why my conscience never sleeps, When you're away somewhere. <br/ >
        Sure was a lucky day, When fate sent you my way, <br/ >
        And made you mine alone for keeps, Ditto to all you say.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Chorus:</em> I've got... No one to talk with, all by myself</strong><br/ >
        No one to walk with, but I'm happy on the shelf,<br/ >
        Ain't Misbehavin', I'm savin' my love for you. <br/ >
        I know for certain the one I love, <br/ >
        I'm thru with flirtin', it's just you I'm thinkin' of,<br/ >
        Ain't Misbehavin', I'm savin' my love for you.
</p>
<p>
<strong> Like Jack Horner in the corner, don't go nowhere, What do I care, </strong><br/ >
         Your kisses are worth waitin' for, believe me.<br/ >
         I don't stay out late, nowhere to be,<br/ >
         I'm home about eight, just me and my old TV,<br/ >
         Ain't Misbehavin', I'm savin' my love for you.<br/ >
         Ain't Misbehavin', I'm savin' my love for you.
